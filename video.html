  <p>This is a video of Andy Warhol simply eating a Burger King burger with some Heinz ketchup.</p>
  <p>This scene was created by Danish filmmaker Jorgen Leth; it appears in his art movie “66 Scenes from America” which
    was filmed in 1981.</p>
    <p>Leth told Warhol about his movie and the idea of having Andy being one of the 66 scenes along with the highly
      “symbolic” burger. Warhol immediately liked the idea and agreed to the scene. Its appeal came from the belief that
      it was such a real scene, something he would like to do.</p>
      <p>When Andy Warhol arrived at Leth's studio he specifically requested the burger be from Mcdonalds, Leth offered
        to have his assistant run into the nearest fast food resteraunt, but Warhol became content with the Burger King
        burger</p>
        <p>The only directions Leth told Warhol were: “You simply have to eat this hamburger. And then after you finished,
          you should just tell the camera, my name is Andy Warhol, I have just eaten a hamburger.” </p>
<p>Why a hamburger? As an emigrant, Warhol admired the idea that in America the same food, drinks etc. are consumed by people
  regardless of their status – the president will drink the same Coke as a layman. The clash of cultures deeply influenced
  the subject matter of his art. A burger might as well appear as a tribute to this aspect of life in America he liked so much.</p>
