  <div class = "poparttext"><p>Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s.
     The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising,
     comic books and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing
     the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical
     means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined
     with unrelated material.</p>
     <p> On the left is perhaps the most famous piece by another top tier pop artist, Roy Lichtenstein, whose medium mostly dealt with the recoloring of comic book scenes.</p>
<p>To read the names of other pop artists(and their most famous paintings) well known for their work in the art movement hover over the button on the left.</p>
